# Analysis Report
## Input
- The program expects an array of data, representing individual cards. Each data item should have a unique identifier (id). The data array is provided to the FlatList component, rendering a grid of cards based on the specified number of columns.

## Process
- Each card is implemented as a CardItem component. The component maintains its state (isScaledUp) to track whether the card is currently scaled up or not. On pressing a card, the toggleScale function is triggered, updating the state and applying a scaling transformation to the card if it's scaled up. The scaling effect is achieved using the transform style property.

## Output
- The output is a visually appealing grid of cards. When a card is clicked, it toggles between a regular and scaled-up state. This interactive scaling effect enhances user engagement and provides a dynamic user interface for the given set of data.
